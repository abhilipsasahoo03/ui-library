## UI Library by moja global

Moja global User-interface (UI) library aims to bring forward an intuitive, consistent, and easy-to-use interface that can help our developers within the User-Interface working group and users to quickly accomplish their tasks. The UI library aims to considerably improve our design & development workflow and meet the acceptable web accessibility requirements for our potential users. A UI library helps us mitigate popular UI-development issues like inconsistent user-experience, performance issues, accessibility requirements and more.
